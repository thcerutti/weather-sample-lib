# Sample project for validation purposes

- Is it possible to install a lib from a pipeline running on CircleCI container?
- Can we call this lib and execute its code?
- Do the lib instalation (yarn add) always get the latest version?

Those and other human related questions will have an answer soon (I hope so `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`).
